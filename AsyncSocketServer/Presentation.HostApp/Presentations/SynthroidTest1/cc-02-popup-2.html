			<p><strong>Study Design:</strong> Adapted from a 1988 biochemical study conducted in<br>
				21 adult Caucasian patients in the United Kingdom with primary<br>
				hypothyroidism who were tested on a series of different thyroxine<br>
				dosages to evaluate effectiveness of measuring TSH levels to monitor<br>
				thyroid function. The "optimal dose" was determined for each patient<br>
				as that dosage of thyroxine being taken when the thyrotropin-releasing<br>
				hormone (TRH) response was normal (ie, an increase in TSH between 4.7<br>
				and 25 mIU/L). Biochemical assessment incorporated measurement of<br>
				serum TSH, T<sub>3</sub>, and T<sub>4</sub>. TSH lower limit of quantification was 0.2 mIU/L<br>
				and upper limit of normal was 5.6 mIU/L, as indicated by the shaded area.<br>
				Each dot represents 1 patient.</p>
