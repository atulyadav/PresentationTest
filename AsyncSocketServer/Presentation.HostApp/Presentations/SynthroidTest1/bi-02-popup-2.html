       <li><strong>Bioequivalent Drug Products.</strong> This term describes pharmaceutical<br>   equivalent or alternative products that display comparable <br>   bioavailability when studied under similar experimental conditions. <br>   According to the law governing FDA regulation of drug products,<br>   drugs are considered bioequivalent if either of the following <br>occurs<sup>4</sup>:
       <ul>
       <li> The rate and extent of absorption of the test drug do not show a<br>  significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the<br>  reference drug when administered at the same molar dose of the<br>  therapeutic ingredient under similar experimental conditions in<br>  either a single dose or multiple doses. </li>
       <li> The extent of absorption of the test drug does not show a <br>  significant difference from the extent of absorption of the reference<br>  drug when administered at the same molar dose of the therapeutic<br>  ingredient under similar experimental conditions in either a single<br>  dose or multiple doses; and the difference from the reference drug<br>  in the rate of absorption of the drug is intentional, is reflected in its<br>  proposed labeling, is not essential to the attainment of effective<br>  body drug concentrations on chronic use, and is considered <br> medically insignificant for the drug.</li>
