            <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong class="sub-head">Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia</strong></p>
            <p>New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbations of diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported in patients receiving protease inhibitors.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="sub-head">PR/QT Interval Prolongation</strong></p>
            <p>QT interval prolongation and cases of torsade de pointes have been reported, although causality of KALETRA could not be established. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, those with hypokalemia, and with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. KALETRA prolongs the PR interval in some patients. Cases of second- and third-degree heart block have been reported. Use with caution in patients with preexisting conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, underlying structural heart disease, or when co-administering KALETRA with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval. Clinical monitoring is recommended.</p>
            
            
            
            <p><strong class="sub-head">Immune Reconstitution Syndrome</strong></p>
            <p>Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients receiving combination ARV therapy, including KALETRA. During the initial phase of ARV treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment. Autoimmune disorders have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution, however, the time to onset is more variable, and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.</p>
            
            
            
            <p><strong class="sub-head">Fat Redistribution</strong></p>
            <p>Redistribution/accumulation of body fat has been observed in patients receiving ARV therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.</p>
