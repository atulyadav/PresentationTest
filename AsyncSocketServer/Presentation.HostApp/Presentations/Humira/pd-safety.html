<p class="head"><strong>Indication<sup>1</sup></strong></p>
<p>KALETRA<sup>®</sup> (lopinavir/ritonavir) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of <br>
	HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients (14 days and older). The following points should be considered <br>
	when initiating therapy with KALETRA:</p>
<p class="bullet">The use of other active agents with KALETRA is associated with a greater likelihood of treatment response.</p>
<p class="bullet">Genotypic or phenotypic testing and/or treatment history should guide the use of KALETRA. The number of baseline lopinavir resistance-associated substitutions affects the virologic response to KALETRA.</p>
<p class="head"><strong>Safety Considerations<sup>1</sup></strong></p>
<p>KALETRA<sup>®</sup> (lopinavir/ritonavir) is contraindicated in patients who have hypersensitivity to the drug or its <br>
	ingredients. Co-administration of KALETRA is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A <br>
	for clearance (possibly resulting in serious and/or life-threatening events) and potent CYP3A inducers (which <br>
	may be associated with loss of virologic response, resistance, and cross-resistance). KALETRA oral solution <br>
	should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities, which could be fatal. Pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, including fatalities, and QT or PR interval prolongation have been reported with KALETRA. Patients may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, and/or immune reconstitution syndrome. Large elevations in total cholesterol and triglycerides have also been reported with KALETRA. Patients may also develop redistribution/accumulation of body fat, and/or increased bleeding in patients with hemophilia types A and B. Please see the Important Safety Information for more details.</p>
