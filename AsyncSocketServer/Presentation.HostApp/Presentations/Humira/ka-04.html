					<h3>
						Indication<sup>1</sup>
					</h3>
					<p>
						KALETRA<sup>Â®</sup> (lopinavir/ritonavir) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with KALETRA:
					</p>
					<div class="blk_bullet">
						The use of other active agents with KALETRA is associated with a greater likelihood of treatment response.
					</div>
					<div class="blk_bullet">
						Genotypic or phenotypic testing and/or treatment history should guide the use of KALETRA. The number of baseline lopinavir resistance-associated substitutions affects the virologic response to KALETRA.
					</div>
					<div class="blk_bullet">
						Once daily administration of KALETRA is not recommended for any pediatric patients.
					</div>
					<h3>
						Safety Considerations
					</h3>
					<p>
						KALETRA is contraindicated in patients who have hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.<br>
						Co-administration of KALETRA is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance (possibly resulting in serious and/or life-threatening events) and potent CYP3A inducers (which may be associated with loss of virologic response, resistance and cross-resistance). Pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity, including fatalities; PR or QT interval prolongation; and large elevations in total cholesterol and triglycerides have been reported with KALETRA. Patients may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, immune reconstitution syndrome, redistribution/accumulation of body fat, and/or increased bleeding in patients with hemophilia type A and B. KALETRA oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities, which could be fatal. Please see the Important Safety Information for more details.
