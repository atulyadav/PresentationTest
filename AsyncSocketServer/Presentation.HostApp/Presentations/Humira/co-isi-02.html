<p><strong class="sub-head">Drug Interactions</strong></p>
            <p>Because KALETRA is a CYP3A inhibitor, the potential for drug-drug interactions, including those that are serious or life-threatening, must be considered prior to and during therapy with KALETRA. Review of other medications taken by patients and monitoring of patients for adverse effects is recommended during therapy with KALETRA. Please see full Prescribing Information for a listing of established and other potentially significant drug interactions.</p>
            <p class="toppad"><u>KALETRA should not be administered once daily in combination with efavirenz, nevirapine, nelfinavir, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin.</u></p>
           
<p><strong class="sub-head">Toxicity in Preterm Neonates</strong></p>	
            <p>KALETRA oral solution contains alcohol and propylene glycol and should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities. A safe and effective dose in this patient population has not been established. Postmarketing life-threatening events, including death, have been reported. Monitor infants closely for increases in serum osmolality and serum creatinine, and for toxicity related to KALETRA oral solution.</p>
  
<p><strong class="sub-head">Pancreatitis</strong></p>
<p>Pancreatitis, including fatalities, has occurred in patients receiving KALETRA, including those who developed marked triglyceride elevations. Suspend therapy as clinically appropriate.</p>

<p><strong class="sub-head">Hepatotoxicity</strong></p>
<p>Hepatotoxicity, including fatalities, has occurred in patients receiving KALETRA. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, or marked transaminase elevations.</p>
