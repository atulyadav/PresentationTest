Cases of second and third degree heart block have been reported. Use with caution in patients with preexisting conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, underlying structural heart disease or when co-administering KALETRA with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval. Clinical monitoring is recommended. QT interval prolongation and cases of torsade de pointes have been reported, although causality of KALETRA could not be established. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, those with hypokalemia, and with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. </p><p>Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients receiving combination ARV therapy, including KALETRA. During the initial phase of ARV treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p> <p>Redistribution/accumulation of body fat has been observed in patients receiving ARV therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.</p> <p>Treatment with KALETRA has resulted in large increases in concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides. Monitor lipids prior to therapy and periodically thereafter.</p> <p>Increased bleeding has been reported in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. Additional factor VIII may be required.</p> <p>Varying degrees of cross-resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed.</p> <p>The safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of KALETRA in pediatric patients below the age of 14 days have not been established. KALETRA once daily has not been evaluated in pediatric patients &lt; 18 years of age.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div><div class="footer"><p><em>continued on next screen</em></p></div></div></div></body></html>
