            <h3>Important Safety Information<sup>1</sup></h3>
            <div>
            <p>KALETRA is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity (e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme) to any of its ingredients, including ritonavir. </p>
            <p>KALETRA is a CYP3A inhibitor. Co-administration of KALETRA is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions, and with potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced lopinavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance and cross-resistance. These contraindicated drugs include alfuzosin, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, midazolam (oral), pimozide, triazolam, rifampin, sildenafil (when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension), St. Johnâ€™s wort (<em>Hypericum perforatum</em>), lovastatin, and simvastatin.</p>
            <p>Because KALETRA is a CYP3A inhibitor, the potential for drug-drug interactions, including those that are serious or life-threatening, must be considered prior to and during therapy with KALETRA. Review of other medications taken by patients and monitoring of patients for adverse effects is recommended during therapy with KALETRA. Please see full Prescribing Information for a listing of established and other potentially significant drug interactions.  </p>
			<p><span class="underline">KALETRA should not be administered once daily in combination with efavirenz, nevirapine, nelfinavir, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin.</span></p>
            <p>KALETRA oral solution contains alcohol and propylene glycol and should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities. A safe and effective dose in this patient population has not been established. Postmarketing life-threatening events, including death, have been reported. Monitor infants closely for increases in serum osmolality and serum creatinine, and for toxicity related to KALETRA oral solution.</p>
            <p>Pancreatitis, including fatalities, has occurred in patients receiving KALETRA, including those who developed marked triglyceride elevations. Suspend therapy as clinically appropriate.</p>
            <p>Hepatotoxicity, including fatalities, has occurred in patients receiving KALETRA. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, or marked transaminase elevations.</p> 
            <p>New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbations of diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported in patients receiving protease inhibitors.</p>
            <p>KALETRA prolongs the PR interval in some patients. Cases of second and third degree heart block have been reported. Use with caution in patients with preexisting conduction system abnormalities, ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathies, underlying structural heart disease or when co-administering KALETRA with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval. Clinical monitoring is recommended. QT interval prolongation and cases of torsade de pointes have been reported, although causality of KALETRA could not be established. Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, those with hypokalemia, and with other drugs that prolong the QT interval. </p>
<p>Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients receiving combination ARV therapy, including KALETRA. During the initial phase of ARV treatment, patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections, which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.</p>
            <p>Redistribution/accumulation of body fat has been observed in patients receiving ARV therapy. The mechanism and long-term consequences of these events are currently unknown.</p>
            <p>Treatment with KALETRA has resulted in large increases in concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycerides. Monitor lipids prior to therapy and periodically thereafter.</p>
            <p>Increased bleeding has been reported in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors. Additional factor VIII may be required.</p>
            <p>Varying degrees of cross-resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed.</p>
            <p>The safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of KALETRA in pediatric patients below the age of 14 days have not been established. KALETRA once daily has not been evaluated in pediatric patients &lt;18 years of age.</p>
            <p>Special attention should be given to accurate calculation of the dose of KALETRA, transcription of the medication order, dispensing information, and dosing instructions to minimize the risk for medication errors and overdose. The appropriate dose must be carefully calculated for each pediatric patient, based on the body weight or body surface area recommendations in the full Prescribing Information, to avoid underdosing or exceeding the recommended adult dose.</p>
			<p>KALETRA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women taking KALETRA. Mothers should be instructed <span class="underline">not to breast-feed if they are receiving KALETRA</span>.</p>
			<p>In KALETRA clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity reported in >5% of adult patients were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, asthenia, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. In children receiving KALETRA oral solution, the most common adverse reactions of any severity were taste aversion, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p>
