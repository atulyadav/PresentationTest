The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with KALETRA:</p> <div class="blk_bullet">The use of other active agents with KALETRA is associated with a greater likelihood of treatment response.</div> <div class="blk_bullet">Genotypic or phenotypic testing and/or treatment history should guide the use of KALETRA. The number of baseline lopinavir resistance-associated substitutions affects the virologic response to KALETRA.</div> <div class="blk_bullet">Once daily administration of KALETRA is not recommended for any pediatric patients.</div> <h3>Important Safety Information</h3> <p>KALETRA is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity <br>(e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme) to any of its ingredients, including ritonavir.</p> <p>KALETRA is a CYP3A inhibitor. Co-administration of KALETRA is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions, and with potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced lopinavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance and cross-resistance. These contraindicated drugs include alfuzosin, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, midazolam (oral), pimozide, triazolam, rifampin, sildenafil (when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension), St. Johnâ€™s wort (<em>Hypericum perforatum</em>), lovastatin, and simvastatin.</p> </div><div class="footer"><p><em>continued on next screen</em></p></div></div></div></body></html>
