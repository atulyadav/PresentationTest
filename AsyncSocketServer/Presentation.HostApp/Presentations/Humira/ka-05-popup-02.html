<p>Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry: To monitor maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to KALETRA, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1-800-258-4263.</p> 
<p>KALETRA is contraindicated in patients who have hypersenstivity to the drug or its ingredients. Co-administration of KALETRA is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance (possibly resulting in serious and/or life-threatening events) and potent CYP3A inducers (which may be associated with loss of virologic response, resistance and cross-resistance).</p>
