<p class="head"><strong>Indication</strong></p>
<p>KALETRA<sup>®</sup> (lopinavir/ritonavir) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of <br>
	HIV-1 infection in adults and pediatric patients (14 days and older). The following points should be considered <br>
	when initiating therapy with KALETRA:</p>
<p class="bullet">The use of other active agents with KALETRA is associated with a greater likelihood of treatment response.</p>
<p class="bullet">Genotypic or phenotypic testing and/or treatment history should guide the use of KALETRA. The number of baseline lopinavir resistance-associated substitutions affects the virologic response to KALETRA.</p>
<p class="head"><strong>Important Safety Information</strong></p>
<p><strong class="sub-head1">Contraindications</strong></p>
<p>KALETRA is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity <br>(e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme) to any of its ingredients, including ritonavir.</p>
<p class="toppad">KALETRA is a CYP3A inhibitor. Co-administration of KALETRA is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions, and with potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced lopinavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance and cross-resistance. These contraindicated drugs include alfuzosin, cisapride, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam, rifampin, sildenafil (Revatio<sup>®</sup>) when used for the treatment <br>of pulmonary arterial hypertension, St. John’s wort (<em>Hypericum perforatum</em>), lovastatin, and simvastatin.</p>
