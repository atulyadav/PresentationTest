Review of other medications taken by patients and monitoring of patients for adverse effects is recommended during therapy with KALETRA. Please see full Prescribing Information for a listing of established and other potentially significant drug interactions. </p> <p><span class="underline">KALETRA should not be administered once daily in combination with efavirenz, nevirapine, nelfinavir, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, or phenytoin.</span></p> <p>KALETRA oral solution contains alcohol and propylene glycol and should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities. A safe and effective dose in this patient population has not been established. Postmarketing life-threatening events, including death, have been reported. Monitor infants closely for increases in serum osmolality and serum creatinine, and for toxicity related to KALETRA oral solution.</p> <p>Pancreatitis, including fatalities, has occurred in patients receiving KALETRA, including those who developed marked triglyceride elevations. Suspend therapy as clinically appropriate.</p> <p>Hepatotoxicity, including fatalities, has occurred in patients receiving KALETRA. Monitor liver function before and during therapy, especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, or marked transaminase elevations.</p> <p>New onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbations of diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia have been reported in patients receiving protease inhibitors.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="footer"><p><em>continued on next screen</em></p></div></div></div></body></html>
