            <p><strong class="sub-head">Patients with Hemophilia</strong></p>
            <p>Increased bleeding has been reported in patients with hemophilia types A and B treated with protease inhibitors. Additional factor VIII may be required.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="sub-head">Resistance/Cross-resistance</strong></p>
            <p>HIV cross-resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored in KALETRA-treated patients; it is unknown what effect therapy with KALETRA will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors.</p>
            
            <p><strong class="sub-head">Pediatric Use</strong></p>
            <p>The safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic profiles of KALETRA in pediatric patients below the age of 14 days have not been established. KALETRA once daily has not been evaluated in pediatric patients.</p>
